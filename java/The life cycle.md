# Life Cycle of a Java Program

The life cycle of a Java program describes the sequence of steps that a Java source code file goes through from being written by a developer to being executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It highlights Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy.

Here are the main stages:

1.  **Source Code (`.java` file)**
2.  **Compilation (Bytecode `javac`)**
3.  **Class Loading (JVM)**
4.  **Bytecode Verification (JVM's Verifier)**
5.  **Execution (JVM & JIT)**
6.  **JVM Shutdown**

---

## 1. Stage: Source Code (`.java` file)

This is where the journey begins. Developers write human-readable Java code in text files, typically with a `.java` extension. These files contain classes, interfaces, and other Java constructs.

### Example: `GreetingProgram.java`

```java
// GreetingProgram.java - Our first source code file

/**
 * This class demonstrates a simple Java program that prints a greeting.
 */
public class GreetingProgram {

    /**
     * The main method is the entry point for the Java application.
     * When the program runs, execution begins here.
     *
     * @param args Command-line arguments (not used in this example).
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print a message to the console
        System.out.println("Hello from the Java Source Code!");
        System.out.println("This is the beginning of our program's life.");
    }
}
```

### Input:

None (This is the raw source code written by the developer).

### Output:

None (This is just a text file).

---

## 2. Stage: Compilation (Bytecode `javac`)

The Java compiler (`javac`) takes the `.java` source code files and translates them into **bytecode**. Bytecode is a platform-independent, low-level instruction set for the JVM. The compiled output files have a `.class` extension.

This is the key to Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle: once compiled into bytecode, the program can run on any system that has a compatible JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.

### Command:

To compile `GreetingProgram.java`:

```bash
javac GreetingProgram.java
```

### Input:

The `GreetingProgram.java` file.

### Output (on File System):

If the compilation is successful, no output is displayed on the console. However, a new file named `GreetingProgram.class` will be created in the same directory as `GreetingProgram.java`. This `.class` file contains the bytecode.

```
.
├── GreetingProgram.java
└── GreetingProgram.class  <-- This is the generated bytecode file
```

You can't directly read the content of `GreetingProgram.class` as it's binary bytecode, but it's ready for the JVM.

---

## 3. Stage: Class Loading (JVM)

When you execute a Java program using the `java` command, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts. One of the first tasks of the JVM is to load the necessary `.class` files into memory. This is done by a component called the **ClassLoader**.

There are different types of ClassLoaders:
*   **Bootstrap ClassLoader:** Loads core Java API classes (e.g., `java.lang.*`, `java.util.*`).
*   **Extension ClassLoader:** Loads classes from the Java extensions directory (`jre/lib/ext`).
*   **Application ClassLoader:** Loads classes from the classpath (your application's `.class` files and JARs).

The ClassLoader finds the `GreetingProgram.class` file (or `InteractiveProgram.class` in our next example) on the specified classpath, reads its bytecode, and makes it available to the JVM for execution.

### Command (triggers loading):

```bash
java GreetingProgram
```

### Input:

The `GreetingProgram.class` file (implicitly read by the JVM).

### Output:

No direct console output for the loading process itself, but it's a prerequisite for the execution stage. If the class file isn't found, you'll get a `NoClassDefFoundError` or `ClassNotFoundException`.

---

## 4. Stage: Bytecode Verification (JVM's Verifier)

Before the JVM executes the loaded bytecode, it performs a crucial security and integrity check called **bytecode verification**. This stage is handled by the **Bytecode Verifier**.

The verifier ensures:
*   The bytecode adheres to the JVM specification.
*   Type safety is maintained (e.g., an `int` is not treated as an `Object`).
*   Memory access is valid (e.g., no illegal pointers, no stack overflows/underflows).
*   No malicious or ill-formed bytecode is executed that could corrupt the JVM or the underlying system.

This stage adds a layer of robustness and security, especially important for applets or code downloaded from untrusted sources.

### Command:

This stage is an internal JVM process, not triggered by a separate command. It happens automatically after class loading and before execution.

### Input:

The loaded bytecode of `GreetingProgram.class`.

### Output:

No direct console output. If verification fails, the JVM will typically throw a `VerifyError`, preventing the problematic code from running. If successful, the bytecode is passed on for execution.

---

## 5. Stage: Execution (JVM & JIT)

This is where the Java program finally runs. The JVM interprets or compiles the bytecode into native machine code and executes the instructions. The entry point for most Java applications is the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.

A key component here is the **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**. The JIT compiler monitors the running program and identifies "hot spots" – parts of the code that are executed frequently. It then compiles these hot spots into optimized native machine code on the fly. This compiled native code runs much faster than interpreted bytecode, significantly improving performance.

### Example: `InteractiveProgram.java` (Demonstrates Input/Output)

```java
// InteractiveProgram.java - A program that interacts with the user

import java.util.Scanner; // Import the Scanner class for input

public class InteractiveProgram {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("\n--- Stage 5: Execution Starts Here ---");

        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the console
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user for their name
        System.out.print("Please enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine(); // Read the entire line of input

        // Prompt the user for their age
        System.out.print("Please enter your age: ");
        int age = -1; // Default value
        try {
            age = scanner.nextInt(); // Read an integer
        } catch (java.util.InputMismatchException e) {
            System.err.println("Invalid age entered. Please enter a number.");
            // Handle the error, perhaps by exiting or asking again
            // For simplicity, we'll just set age to a default and continue.
        }
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume the remaining newline character after reading the integer

        // Process and display the information
        System.out.println("\nHello, " + name + "!");
        if (age != -1) {
            System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");
            if (age < 18) {
                System.out.println("You are considered a minor.");
            } else if (age >= 18 && age < 65) {
                System.out.println("You are considered an adult.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("You are considered a senior citizen.");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Couldn't determine your age due to invalid input.");
        }

        // Close the scanner to release system resources
        scanner.close();

        System.out.println("--- Program Finished Executing ---");
    }
}
```

### Steps to Compile and Run `InteractiveProgram.java`:

1.  **Compile:**
    ```bash
    javac InteractiveProgram.java
    ```
    (This will create `InteractiveProgram.class`)

2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    java InteractiveProgram
    ```

### Input (User enters this during execution):

```
Alice
25
```

### Output (Console output after running):

```
--- Stage 5: Execution Starts Here ---
Please enter your name: Alice
Please enter your age: 25

Hello, Alice!
You are 25 years old.
You are considered an adult.
--- Program Finished Executing ---
```

---

## 6. Stage: JVM Shutdown

The final stage is the termination of the Java Virtual Machine. This happens when:

*   **Normal Termination:**
    *   The `main` method completes its execution.
    *   All non-daemon (user-defined) threads have finished their execution.
    *   The program explicitly calls `System.exit()`.
*   **Abnormal Termination:**
    *   An uncaught exception or error occurs (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`).
    *   An external event like a user forcing shutdown (`Ctrl+C` or `kill` command).

During shutdown, the JVM performs cleanup operations, such as calling shutdown hooks (if registered), closing open resources (like files or network connections, although it's best practice to close them explicitly in your code as shown with `scanner.close()`), and releasing memory.

### Example (Implicit in `InteractiveProgram.java`):

When `InteractiveProgram.main()` finishes, and the `scanner.close()` method is called, the JVM detects that there are no more active user threads and naturally shuts down.

### Input:

None (JVM is winding down).

### Output:

None explicitly shown for the shutdown process itself. The program's last output marks the end of its active execution.

# JShell in Java: A Comprehensive Guide

JShell is an interactive Java Shell tool introduced in **Java 9** as part of Project Kulla. It provides a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment that allows you to execute Java code snippets interactively, without the need for traditional `public static void main` boilerplate or compiling `.java` files explicitly.

It's an excellent tool for:
*   **Learning Java:** Experiment with language features quickly.
*   **Prototyping:** Test small code snippets and ideas.
*   **Debugging:** Isolate and test specific pieces of logic.
*   **Quick Calculations:** Use Java as a powerful calculator.

## 1. What is JShell?

JShell is a **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for Java.
*   **Read:** JShell reads the Java code you type.
*   **Eval:** It evaluates (executes) the code.
*   **Print:** It prints the result of the evaluation.
*   **Loop:** It then loops back, ready for your next input.

It allows you to enter Java declarations, statements, and expressions directly into the command line, and see immediate results.

---

## 2. Getting Started

To use JShell, you need **Java Development Kit (JDK) 9 or newer** installed on your system.

**Launching JShell:**
Open your terminal or command prompt and simply type `jshell`:

```bash
jshell
```

You should see a welcome message similar to this:

```
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 21.0.2
|  For overview, type /help intro
jshell>
```

The `jshell>` prompt indicates that JShell is ready for your input.

---

## 3. Basic Usage: Expressions and Variables

You can type any valid Java expression, statement, or declaration. JShell automatically handles semicolons for simple expressions if you omit them.

### Expressions

```java
jshell> 2 + 2
$1 ==> 4

jshell> "Hello" + " JShell"
$2 ==> "Hello JShell"

jshell> System.out.println("Hello, World!");
Hello, World!
```
*   **`$` variables:** Notice `$1`, `$2` etc. JShell automatically creates numbered variables for the results of expressions that are not assigned to a named variable. You can use these variables in subsequent calculations.

```java
jshell> $1 * 10
$3 ==> 40

jshell> String greeting = $2 + "!";
greeting ==> "Hello JShell!"
```

### Variables

You can declare and initialize variables just like in a regular Java program.

```java
jshell> int x = 10;
x ==> 10

jshell> x * 5
$4 ==> 50

jshell> String name = "Alice";
name ==> "Alice"

jshell> System.out.println("My name is " + name);
My name is Alice
```

### Type Inference with `var`

JShell fully supports `var` (local variable type inference) introduced in Java 10.

```java
jshell> var message = "Learning JShell is fun!";
message ==> "Learning JShell is fun!"

jshell> var pi = 3.14159;
pi ==> 3.14159

jshell> pi instanceof Double
$5 ==> true
```

---

## 4. Working with Methods

You can define and call methods directly.

### Simple Method

```java
jshell> int add(int a, int b) {
   ...> return a + b;
   ...> }
|  created method add(int,int)

jshell> add(5, 3)
$6 ==> 8

jshell> add(100, 200)
$7 ==> 300
```
*   **Multiline input:** When you type an incomplete statement (like a method declaration), JShell provides a `...>` prompt, indicating it expects more input. Press Enter again after completing the block.

### Method Overloading

```java
jshell> double add(double a, double b) {
   ...> return a + b;
   ...> }
|  created method add(double,double)

jshell> add(2.5, 3.5)
$8 ==> 6.0

jshell> add(2, 3) // Calls the int version
$9 ==> 5
```

---

## 5. Defining Classes and Interfaces

You can also define full classes and interfaces within JShell.

### Simple Class

```java
jshell> class Greeter {
   ...>     String greet(String name) {
   ...>         return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   ...>     }
   ...> }
|  created class Greeter

jshell> Greeter myGreeter = new Greeter();
myGreeter ==> Greeter@3ecf7344

jshell> myGreeter.greet("World")
$10 ==> "Hello, World!!"

jshell> myGreeter.greet("JShell User")
$11 ==> "Hello, JShell User!"
```

### Interface and Anonymous Class

```java
jshell> interface Calculator {
   ...>     int calculate(int x, int y);
   ...> }
|  created interface Calculator

jshell> Calculator adder = new Calculator() {
   ...>     @Override
   ...>     public int calculate(int x, int y) {
   ...>         return x + y;
   ...>     }
   ...> };
adder ==> jdk.jshell.SnippetEvent$SubKind$1@47fd187b

jshell> adder.calculate(10, 20)
$12 ==> 30
```

---

## 6. Imports

Just like in regular Java, you can import classes to use them without their fully qualified names. JShell automatically imports some common packages by default (e.g., `java.io.*`, `java.math.*`, `java.net.*`, `java.nio.file.*`, `java.util.*`, `java.util.concurrent.*`, `java.util.function.*`, `java.util.prefs.*`, `java.util.regex.*`, `java.util.stream.*`).

```java
jshell> import java.util.ArrayList;

jshell> ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names ==> []

jshell> names.add("Alice");
$13 ==> true

jshell> names.add("Bob");
$14 ==> true

jshell> names
names ==> [Alice, Bob]

jshell> import java.time.LocalDate;

jshell> LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
today ==> 2023-10-27
```

---

## 7. Error Handling

JShell provides immediate feedback on syntax and runtime errors, making it easy to spot and correct mistakes.

### Syntax Error

```java
jshell> int num = ;
|  Error:
|    ';' expected
|    int num = ;
|              ^
```

### Runtime Error

```java
jshell> int[] arr = {};
arr ==> []

jshell> arr[0]
|  Exception java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0
|        at (#19:1)
```

---

## 8. JShell Commands

JShell has a set of built-in commands (prefixed with `/`) to manage your session.

*   **`/help`**: Displays general help or help for a specific command.
    ```bash
    jshell> /help
    |  Type a Java language expression, statement, or declaration.
    |  Or type one of the following commands:
    |  /list [<id>|<name>|-all|-start]
    |    Lists the source you have entered, or the current startup snippets.
    |    ... (truncated output for brevity) ...
    jshell> /help /list
    |  /list <id>|<name>|-all|-start
    |    Lists the source you have entered, or the current startup snippets.
    |    ... (truncated output for brevity) ...
    ```

*   **`/list`**: Lists all snippets you have entered so far.
    ```java
    jshell> int a = 10;
    a ==> 10

    jshell> String message = "Hello";
    message ==> "Hello"

    jshell> /list
    s1 : int a = 10;
    s2 : String message = "Hello";
    ```
    You can also list specific snippets by ID (`/list s1`) or see startup snippets (`/list -start`).

*   **`/vars`**: Lists all declared variables and their current values.
    ```java
    jshell> /vars
    |    int a = 10
    |    String message = "Hello"
    ```

*   **`/methods`**: Lists all defined methods.
    ```java
    jshell> /methods
    |    int add(int,int)
    |    double add(double,double)
    ```

*   **`/types`**: Lists all defined classes, interfaces, and enums.
    ```java
    jshell> /types
    |    class Greeter
    |    interface Calculator
    ```

*   **`/imports`**: Lists all active imports.
    ```java
    jshell> /imports
    |    import java.io.*
    |    import java.math.*
    |    ... (default imports) ...
    |    import java.util.ArrayList
    |    import java.time.LocalDate
    ```

*   **`/drop <id>`**: Removes a snippet by its ID. This can be useful if you make a mistake or want to re-declare something.
    ```java
    jshell> int temp = 50;
    temp ==> 50

    jshell> /list
    s1 : int a = 10;
    s2 : String message = "Hello";
    s3 : int temp = 50;

    jshell> /drop s3
    |  dropped snippet temp

    jshell> /list
    s1 : int a = 10;
    s2 : String message = "Hello";
    ```

*   **`/reset`**: Clears the current JShell session, effectively starting fresh. All variables, methods, and classes are removed.
    ```java
    jshell> /reset
    |  Resetting JShell state.
    |  For overview, type /help intro
    jshell> /vars
    |  No active variables.
    ```

*   **`/exit`**: Exits the JShell environment.
    ```bash
    jshell> /exit
    Goodbye
    ```

*   **`/save <filename.jsh>`**: Saves the current session history (all valid snippets) to a file.
*   **`/open <filename.jsh>`**: Opens and executes commands from a JShell script file (`.jsh`) or a Java source file (`.java`).

*   **`/history`**: Shows the command history of the current session.
    ```java
    jshell> /history
    1 : 2 + 2
    2 : "Hello" + " JShell"
    ... (more commands) ...
    ```

*   **`/edit <id>`**: Opens an external editor (configured by the `EDITOR` environment variable) to modify a snippet.

## 9. Saving and Loading Sessions

JShell allows you to save your current work and load it later.

### Saving a Session

Let's define some things:
```java
jshell> String username = "JShellUser";
username ==> "JShellUser"

jshell> int multiply(int x, int y) { return x * y; }
|  created method multiply(int,int)

jshell> /save my_jshell_session.jsh
```

This will create a file named `my_jshell_session.jsh` in your current directory with the contents:

```java
String username = "JShellUser";
int multiply(int x, int y) { return x * y; }
```

### Loading a Session

You can load this file into a new or existing JShell session:

```bash
jshell
```
(inside JShell)
```java
jshell> /open my_jshell_session.jsh
username ==> "JShellUser"
|  created method multiply(int,int)

jshell> username
username ==> "JShellUser"

jshell> multiply(7, 8)
$15 ==> 56
```

## 10. Why Use JShell? (Benefits)

*   **Instant Feedback:** No compile-run-debug cycle for small code changes.
*   **Reduced Boilerplate:** No need for classes, `main` methods, or verbose structure for quick tests.
*   **Learning Aid:** Excellent for exploring new APIs, language features, and practicing syntax.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly test out algorithms or ideas before integrating them into a larger project.
*   **Interactive Debugging:** Isolate and test specific functions or lines of code.

---

## 11. Limitations

While powerful, JShell isn't a replacement for a full IDE or a structured development environment.
*   **No Project Management:** Not suitable for managing large, multi-file projects.
*   **Limited Debugging Tools:** While you get immediate results, advanced debugging features (like breakpoints, step-through execution) are not present.
*   **No IDE Integration:** It's a command-line tool. While some IDEs might integrate REPL-like features, JShell itself is separate.
*   **Session-Based:** Your work only persists if you explicitly save it using `/save`.

## 1. `final` Keyword

The `final` keyword in Java is used to restrict the user. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.

### 1.1. `final` Variables

When a variable is declared as `final`, its value cannot be changed once it has been initialized. It essentially makes the variable a constant.

*   **Primitive `final` Variables:** The value itself cannot be re-assigned.
*   **Reference `final` Variables:** The reference (the memory address it points to) cannot be changed to point to a different object. However, the *contents* or *state* of the object it points to *can* be modified if the object itself is mutable.

**Initialization:**
*   A `final` variable must be initialized either at the time of declaration or within a constructor (for instance variables) or a static initializer block (for static variables).

**Example: `final` Variables**

```java
// FinalVariableExample.java
public class FinalVariableExample {

    // A final instance variable, initialized in the constructor
    final int instanceConstant; 

    // A final static variable (class-level constant)
    final static double PI = 3.14159;

    public FinalVariableExample(int value) {
        this.instanceConstant = value; // Initialize instanceConstant
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // --- Primitive final variable ---
        final int MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3;
        System.out.println("Max Attempts (initial): " + MAX_ATTEMPTS);
        // MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5; // COMPILE ERROR: cannot assign a value to final variable MAX_ATTEMPTS

        // --- Reference final variable ---
        final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        System.out.println("StringBuilder (initial): " + sb);

        sb.append(" World"); // OK: Can modify the object's content
        System.out.println("StringBuilder (after append): " + sb);

        // sb = new StringBuilder("Goodbye"); // COMPILE ERROR: cannot assign a value to final variable sb

        // --- Instance final variable ---
        FinalVariableExample obj1 = new FinalVariableExample(100);
        System.out.println("Instance Constant for obj1: " + obj1.instanceConstant);
        // obj1.instanceConstant = 200; // COMPILE ERROR: cannot assign a value to final variable instanceConstant

        FinalVariableExample obj2 = new FinalVariableExample(50);
        System.out.println("Instance Constant for obj2: " + obj2.instanceConstant);

        // --- Static final variable ---
        System.out.println("PI: " + FinalVariableExample.PI);
        // FinalVariableExample.PI = 3.0; // COMPILE ERROR: cannot assign a value to final variable PI
    }
}
```

**Input:**
(No explicit input, runs as a standard Java application)

**Output:**
```
Max Attempts (initial): 3
StringBuilder (initial): Hello
StringBuilder (after append): Hello World
Instance Constant for obj1: 100
Instance Constant for obj2: 50
PI: 3.14159
```

### 1.2. `final` Methods

When a method is declared as `final`, it cannot be overridden by any subclass. This means its implementation is fixed and cannot be changed by extending classes.

**Use Cases:**
*   To prevent critical logic from being altered by subclasses.
*   For security reasons (e.g., in framework methods).
*   Performance optimization (JVM can sometimes inline `final` methods).

**Example: `final` Methods**

```java
// FinalMethodExample.java

class Vehicle {
    final void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle: Engine started with standard procedure.");
    }

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle: Driving.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Attempting to override startEngine() will result in a compile error
    /*
    @Override
    void startEngine() { // COMPILE ERROR: startEngine() in Car cannot override startEngine() in Vehicle; overridden method is final
        System.out.println("Car: Engine started with advanced procedure.");
    }
    */

    @Override
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car: Driving on four wheels.");
    }
}

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle: Riding on two wheels.");
    }
}

public class FinalMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.startEngine(); // Calls the final method from Vehicle
        myCar.drive();       // Calls the overridden method from Car

        System.out.println("---");

        Motorcycle myMotorcycle = new Motorcycle();
        myMotorcycle.startEngine(); // Calls the final method from Vehicle
        myMotorcycle.drive();       // Calls the overridden method from Motorcycle
    }
}
```

**Input:**
(No explicit input)

**Output:**
```
Vehicle: Engine started with standard procedure.
Car: Driving on four wheels.
---
Vehicle: Engine started with standard procedure.
Motorcycle: Riding on two wheels.
```

### 1.3. `final` Classes

When a class is declared as `final`, it cannot be subclassed (inherited from). This means no other class can extend it.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Immutability:** Classes like `String` are `final` to ensure their immutability. If `String` could be subclassed, a malicious subclass could potentially alter its behavior.
*   **Security:** To prevent untrusted code from extending a class and potentially compromising its functionality.
*   **Design:** When a class's implementation is complete and should not be extended.

**Example: `final` Classes**

```java
// FinalClassExample.java

final class ImmutablePoint {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public ImmutablePoint(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public int getY() {
        return y;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "ImmutablePoint(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
    }
}

// Attempting to extend ImmutablePoint will result in a compile error
/*
class ColoredPoint extends ImmutablePoint { // COMPILE ERROR: cannot inherit from final ImmutablePoint
    private String color;

    public ColoredPoint(int x, int y, String color) {
        super(x, y);
        this.color = color;
    }
    // ...
}
*/

public class FinalClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ImmutablePoint p1 = new ImmutablePoint(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Point: " + p1);

        // Once created, x and y cannot be changed (because they are final in ImmutablePoint)
        // p1.x = 30; // Not allowed (x is private and final)
    }
}
```

**Input:**
(No explicit input)

**Output:**
```
Point: ImmutablePoint(10, 20)
```

## 2. `finally` Block

The `finally` block is used in conjunction with a `try-catch` block. The code inside the `finally` block is **guaranteed to execute**, whether an exception occurs in the `try` block or not, and regardless of whether the `catch` block handles the exception.

**Purpose:**
The primary purpose of `finally` is to perform **cleanup operations**, such as:
*   Closing file streams.
*   Closing database connections.
*   Releasing network sockets.
*   Releasing locks.

**Execution Scenarios:**
*   If no exception occurs: `try` block finishes, then `finally` executes.
*   If an exception occurs and is caught: `try` block runs until exception, `catch` block executes, then `finally` executes.
*   If an exception occurs and is NOT caught (or re-thrown): `try` block runs until exception, `finally` executes, then the exception propagates up the call stack.

**When `finally` might NOT execute (rare cases):**
*   If the JVM crashes.
*   If `System.exit()` is called from the `try` or `catch` block.
*   If the thread executing the `try` or `catch` block is killed.

**Interaction with `return` statements:**
If a `try` or `catch` block contains a `return` statement, the `finally` block will execute *before* the method actually returns. If the `finally` block also contains a `return` statement, that return will override any previous returns.

**Example: `finally` Block**

```java
// FinallyExample.java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FinallyExample {

    public static void readFile(String filePath) {
        BufferedReader reader = null; // Declare outside try to be accessible in finally
        try {
            System.out.println("Attempting to open file: " + filePath);
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath));
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Read line: " + line);
            }
            // Simulate an error after reading
            if (filePath.contains("invalid")) {
                throw new IOException("Simulated error while reading.");
            }
            System.out.println("File reading completed successfully.");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Caught an IOException: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("--- Inside finally block ---");
            if (reader != null) {
                try {
                    reader.close(); // Close the resource
                    System.out.println("BufferedReader closed successfully.");
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    System.err.println("Error closing BufferedReader: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("BufferedReader was not initialized or already null.");
            }
            System.out.println("--- Exiting finally block ---");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Scenario 1: File exists and no simulated error
        System.out.println("\n--- Scenario 1: Successful file read ---");
        // Create a dummy file for testing
        createDummyFile("testfile.txt", "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3");
        readFile("testfile.txt");

        // Scenario 2: File does not exist (IOException during FileReader creation)
        System.out.println("\n--- Scenario 2: File not found error ---");
        readFile("nonexistent.txt");

        // Scenario 3: File exists, but simulated error during reading
        System.out.println("\n--- Scenario 3: Simulated error during read ---");
        createDummyFile("simulated_invalid_file.txt", "Data A\nData B");
        readFile("simulated_invalid_file.txt");

        // Java 7+ try-with-resources (preferred way for resource management)
        System.out.println("\n--- Scenario 4: Using try-with-resources (preferred) ---");
        try (BufferedReader autoReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("testfile.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = autoReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Auto-read line: " + line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Caught an IOException with try-with-resources: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.println("Resources are automatically closed by try-with-resources.");
    }

    private static void createDummyFile(String filename, String content) {
        try (java.io.FileWriter writer = new java.io.FileWriter(filename)) {
            writer.write(content);
            System.out.println("Created dummy file: " + filename);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error creating dummy file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Input:**
(No explicit input, but `testfile.txt` and `simulated_invalid_file.txt` are created programmatically)

**Output:**
```
Created dummy file: testfile.txt

--- Scenario 1: Successful file read ---
Attempting to open file: testfile.txt
Read line: Line 1
Read line: Line 2
Read line: Line 3

<a name="3-finalize-method-deprecated"></a>
## 3. `finalize()` Method (Deprecated)

The `finalize()` method is a `protected` method in the `java.lang.Object` class. It is invoked by the Garbage Collector (GC) on an object **just before** that object is garbage collected.

**Signature:** `protected void finalize() throws Throwable`

**Original Purpose:**
To perform cleanup operations on unmanaged resources (like native system resources, C++ pointers, etc.) before an object is destroyed by the GC. For example, closing a file handle opened by native code.

### Why it's Problematic and Deprecated

**`finalize()` is highly discouraged and rarely used in modern Java development.** It was officially deprecated in Java 9 and is completely removed in Java 18 (with alternatives like `Cleaner` available). Here's why:

1.  **Unpredictable Execution:** There is no guarantee *when* or even *if* `finalize()` will be called. The JVM's Garbage Collector runs non-deterministically, based on memory pressure. An object might remain in memory for a long time, or the JVM might exit before the GC gets a chance to finalize it.
2.  **Performance Overhead:** Objects that override `finalize()` are placed in a special queue by the GC. This adds significant overhead and can slow down the garbage collection process.
3.  **Resource Leaks:** Due to unpredictable execution, `finalize()` cannot be relied upon for critical resource cleanup. If a resource is only closed in `finalize()`, it can lead to resource leaks if `finalize()` isn't called in a timely manner, or at all.
4.  **Security Vulnerabilities:** It's possible to "resurrect" an object within its `finalize()` method (e.g., by making it reachable again from a static field). This can lead to security exploits or unexpected behavior.
5.  **Exceptions are Ignored:** Any exception thrown from `finalize()` is silently ignored by the JVM, making debugging extremely difficult.

### Modern Alternatives

Instead of `finalize()`, use these robust and predictable mechanisms for resource management:

*   **`try-with-resources` (Java 7+):** For resources that implement `AutoCloseable` (like `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, etc.). This is the **preferred way** to manage resources that need to be closed.
*   **`finally` block:** For general cleanup that doesn't fit `try-with-resources` or for ensuring specific code execution paths.
*   **`java.lang.ref.Cleaner` (Java 9+):** For more complex scenarios involving native resources where explicit cleanup is not always possible or desirable (e.g., when dealing with off-heap memory). It offers a more reliable, but still non-deterministic, alternative to `finalize()` for specific use cases.

**Example: `finalize()` Method (Demonstrating Unpredictability)**

```java
// FinalizeExample.java

class MyResource {
    private String name;
    private boolean closed = false;

    public MyResource(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        System.out.println("MyResource '" + name + "' created.");
    }

    // A method to explicitly close the resource (recommended)
    public void close() {
        if (!closed) {
            System.out.println("MyResource '" + name + "' explicitly closed.");
            closed = true;
        }
    }

    // The problematic finalize method
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            if (!closed) {
                System.out.println("MyResource '" + name + "' finalized by GC.");
                // Simulate releasing a resource
                // Note: Exceptions here would be ignored!
            } else {
                System.out.println("MyResource '" + name + "' finalized, but was already closed.");
            }
        } finally {
            super.finalize(); // Always call super.finalize() if overriding
        }
    }
}

public class FinalizeExample {

    public static void createObjectsForGC() {
        System.out.println("\n--- Creating objects for GC ---");
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            new MyResource("Resource-" + i); // Objects become eligible for GC after this method
        }
        System.out.println("--- Finished creating objects for GC ---");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Scenario 1: Objects created, GC might run later (or not at all before exit)
        createObjectsForGC();

        System.out.println("\n--- Requesting GC (might or might not run finalize immediately) ---");
        System.gc(); // Hint to the JVM to run garbage collection
        Thread.sleep(100); // Give GC a little time (still no guarantee)

        // Scenario 2: Object explicitly closed, then GC
        System.out.println("\n--- Explicitly closing and then GC ---");
        MyResource resourceToClose = new MyResource("ExplicitlyClosedResource");
        resourceToClose.close(); // Explicitly close the resource
        resourceToClose = null; // Make it eligible for GC

        System.gc();
        Thread.sleep(100);

        System.out.println("\n--- Main method exiting ---");
        // Finalize methods *might* be called now, or never, depending on GC behavior.
        // You might see output from finalize, or you might not.
        // The order is also not guaranteed.
    }
}
```

**Input:**
(No explicit input)

**Output (Example - actual output may vary significantly due to GC non-determinism):**
```
--- Creating objects for GC ---
MyResource 'Resource-0' created.
MyResource 'Resource-1' created.
MyResource 'Resource-2' created.
MyResource 'Resource-3' created.
MyResource 'Resource-4' created.
--- Finished creating objects for GC ---

--- Requesting GC (might or might not run finalize immediately) ---
MyResource 'Resource-1' finalized by GC.
MyResource 'Resource-0' finalized by GC.
MyResource 'Resource-3' finalized by GC.
MyResource 'Resource-2' finalized by GC.
MyResource 'Resource-4' finalized by GC.

--- Explicitly closing and then GC ---
MyResource 'ExplicitlyClosedResource' created.
MyResource 'ExplicitlyClosedResource' explicitly closed.
MyResource 'ExplicitlyClosedResource' finalized, but was already closed.

--- Main method exiting ---
```
**Explanation of Output:**
Notice how the `finalize()` calls for "Resource-X" might appear, but their order is not guaranteed. For "ExplicitlyClosedResource," you'll see both the explicit `close()` message *and* the `finalized, but was already closed` message, demonstrating that `finalize()` *can* still run even after explicit cleanup. This highlights its redundancy and potential for confusion. If you run this multiple times, the output for the `finalize()` messages (especially their appearance and order) can differ. On some runs, you might not see any `finalized` messages at all if the GC doesn't run before the program exits.

## Conclusion

While `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` share a linguistic root, their roles in Java are fundamentally different:

*   **`final`** is about **immutability and restriction** in your code's design.
*   **`finally`** is about **guaranteeing execution** for critical operations, primarily resource management.
*   **`finalize()`** was an attempt at automatic resource cleanup, but its **unpredictable and unreliable nature** led to its deprecation and disuse in favor of more robust mechanisms like `try-with-resources`.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for writing robust, efficient, and maintainable Java applications.

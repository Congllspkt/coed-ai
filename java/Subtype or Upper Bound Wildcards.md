Java Generics Wildcards (`? extends T` and `? super T`) are powerful features that allow you to write more flexible and reusable code while maintaining type safety. They address the limitation that `List<Dog>` is *not* a subtype of `List<Animal`, even though `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`.

Let's break them down.

# Java Generics Wildcards: `? extends T` (Upper Bounded) vs. `? super T` (Lower Bounded)

## Introduction to Wildcards

In Java, if you have a `List<Dog>`, you cannot pass it to a method that expects a `List<Animal>`. This is because if Java allowed it, you could then add a `Cat` (which is an `Animal` but not a `Dog`) to the `List<Dog>`, leading to a `ClassCastException` later.

Wildcards solve this by introducing flexibility while preserving type safety. They allow you to define a range for the unknown type parameter.

The core principle to remember is **PECS**: **P**roducer `extends`, **C**onsumer `super`.

## 1. `? extends T` (Upper Bounded Wildcard)

This is also sometimes referred to as a "Subtype Wildcard" because it means the unknown type (`?`) must be `T` or a subtype of `T`.

*   **Syntax:** `? extends T`
*   **Meaning:** The unknown type can be `T` or any class that extends `T`.
*   **Purpose:** Primarily for **reading** or **producing** elements from a collection. You can iterate over elements and safely treat them as type `T` (or a supertype of `T`).
*   **Analogy:** A **Producer**. It produces elements of type `T` (or a subtype).
*   **Key Rule:**
    *   **Can Read:** You can read elements from a collection declared with `? extends T` as type `T`. For example, if you have `List<? extends Animal>`, you can get an `Animal` object from it.
    *   **Cannot Write (Add):** You **cannot** add any elements to a collection declared with `? extends T` (except `null`). This is because you don't know the exact subtype. If it's `List<? extends Animal>`, it might actually be `List<Dog>`. If you tried to add a `Cat` to it, it would violate the type safety of `List<Dog>`.

### Example: Processing Animals

Let's imagine a class hierarchy: `Animal` -> `Dog` -> `Poodle`.

```java
// Animal.java
class Animal {
    String name;
    public Animal(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    @Override
    public String toString() { return "Animal: " + name; }
}

// Dog.java
class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) { super(name); }
    @Override
    public String toString() { return "Dog: " + name; }
}

// Poodle.java
class Poodle extends Dog {
    public Poodle(String name) { super(name); }
    @Override
    public String toString() { return "Poodle: " + name; }
}

// UpperBoundedWildcardExample.java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class UpperBoundedWildcardExample {

    // This method can accept a List of Animal, Dog, Poodle, or any subtype of Animal.
    public static void printAnimals(List<? extends Animal> animals) {
        System.out.println("--- Printing Animals (Read-Only Access) ---");
        for (Animal animal : animals) { // Safe to read as Animal
            System.out.println("Found: " + animal.getName());
        }

        // --- ATTEMPTING TO ADD ELEMENTS (WILL NOT COMPILE) ---
        // animals.add(new Dog("Buddy")); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Cannot add specific types
        // animals.add(new Poodle("Fluffy")); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR
        // animals.add(new Animal("General Animal")); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR
        
        // The only thing you can safely add is null (which doesn't add a specific type)
        animals.add(null); 
        System.out.println("Null can be added. Current size: " + animals.size());
        System.out.println("----------------------------------------");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create lists of different Animal subtypes
        List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<>();
        dogs.add(new Dog("Buddy"));
        dogs.add(new Dog("Lucy"));

        List<Poodle> poodles = new ArrayList<>();
        poodles.add(new Poodle("Fluffy"));
        poodles.add(new Poodle("Sparky"));

        List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<>();
        animals.add(new Animal("General Animal"));
        animals.add(new Dog("Max")); // A Dog is an Animal

        // Call the method with different list types
        System.out.println("\nCalling printAnimals with List<Dog>:");
        printAnimals(dogs);

        System.out.println("\nCalling printAnimals with List<Poodle>:");
        printAnimals(poodles);
        
        System.out.println("\nCalling printAnimals with List<Animal>:");
        printAnimals(animals);
        
        // List<Object> objects = new ArrayList<>();
        // objects.add(new Object());
        // printAnimals(objects); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Object is not a subtype of Animal
    }
}
```

**Input:**
(No direct user input; the program uses pre-defined lists)

**Output (Console):**

```
Calling printAnimals with List<Dog>:
--- Printing Animals (Read-Only Access) ---
Found: Buddy
Found: Lucy
Null can be added. Current size: 3
----------------------------------------

Calling printAnimals with List<Poodle>:
--- Printing Animals (Read-Only Access) ---
Found: Fluffy
Found: Sparky
Null can be added. Current size: 3
----------------------------------------

Calling printAnimals with List<Animal>:
--- Printing Animals (Read-Only Access) ---
Found: General Animal
Found: Max
Null can be added. Current size: 3
----------------------------------------
```

**Explanation:**
The `printAnimals` method can accept `List<Dog>`, `List<Poodle>`, or `List<Animal>` because `Dog` and `Poodle` are subtypes of `Animal`. Inside the method, we can safely iterate and retrieve elements as `Animal` objects because we are guaranteed that whatever is in the list is *at least* an `Animal`. However, if you uncomment the `animals.add(...)` lines, the compiler will show an error, preventing you from adding elements of specific types, ensuring type safety. You can only add `null` as it doesn't represent a specific type that could break the unknown underlying type.

---

## 2. `? super T` (Lower Bounded Wildcard)

*   **Syntax:** `? super T`
*   **Meaning:** The unknown type can be `T` or any class that is a supertype of `T`.
*   **Purpose:** Primarily for **writing** or **consuming** elements into a collection. You can add elements of type `T` (or a subtype of `T`) to the collection.
*   **Analogy:** A **Consumer**. It consumes (accepts) elements of type `T` (or a subtype).
*   **Key Rule:**
    *   **Can Write (Add):** You can add elements of type `T` or any subtype of `T` to a collection declared with `? super T`. For example, if you have `List<? super Dog>`, you can add `Dog` objects or `Poodle` objects (since `Poodle` extends `Dog`).
    *   **Cannot Read (Get):** You **cannot** read elements from a collection declared with `? super T` as type `T` (or any specific type except `Object`). This is because you don't know the exact supertype. If it's `List<? super Dog>`, it might actually be `List<Animal>` or `List<Object>`. While you know it holds `Dog`s or its supertypes, when you retrieve an element, the only guaranteed common supertype for *all* possible elements is `Object`.

### Example: Adding Dogs to a List

Using the same `Animal`, `Dog`, `Poodle` hierarchy.

```java
// Animal, Dog, Poodle classes (as defined above)

// LowerBoundedWildcardExample.java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class LowerBoundedWildcardExample {

    // This method can accept a List of Dog, Animal, Object, or any supertype of Dog.
    public static void addDogAndPoodles(List<? super Dog> dogConsumerList) {
        System.out.println("--- Adding Dogs (Write-Only Access) ---");
        dogConsumerList.add(new Dog("Rex"));        // OK: Dog is a Dog
        dogConsumerList.add(new Poodle("Princess")); // OK: Poodle is a subtype of Dog

        // --- ATTEMPTING TO ADD INVALID ELEMENTS (WILL NOT COMPILE) ---
        // dogConsumerList.add(new Animal("Lion")); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Animal is not a subtype of Dog
        // dogConsumerList.add(new Object()); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Object is not a subtype of Dog

        System.out.println("Successfully added dogs to the list. Current size: " + dogConsumerList.size());

        // --- ATTEMPTING TO READ ELEMENTS (LIMITED ACCESS) ---
        // Dog retrievedDog = dogConsumerList.get(0); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Cannot cast to Dog
        // Poodle retrievedPoodle = (Poodle) dogConsumerList.get(1); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Cannot cast to Poodle without explicit cast to Object first

        Object obj = dogConsumerList.get(0); // OK: Can only read as Object
        System.out.println("First element (read as Object): " + obj);
        System.out.println("----------------------------------------");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create lists of different types that can consume Dogs
        List<Animal> animals = new ArrayList<>();
        System.out.println("\nCalling addDogAndPoodles with List<Animal>:");
        addDogAndPoodles(animals);
        System.out.println("Content of List<Animal>: " + animals);

        List<Object> objects = new ArrayList<>();
        System.out.println("\nCalling addDogAndPoodles with List<Object>:");
        addDogAndPoodles(objects);
        System.out.println("Content of List<Object>: " + objects);
        
        List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<>();
        System.out.println("\nCalling addDogAndPoodles with List<Dog>:");
        addDogAndPoodles(dogs); // List<Dog> is a valid consumer of Dog
        System.out.println("Content of List<Dog>: " + dogs);
        
        // List<Poodle> poodles = new ArrayList<>();
        // addDogAndPoodles(poodles); // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: Poodle is a subtype, not a supertype of Dog
    }
}
```

**Input:**
(No direct user input; the program uses pre-defined lists)

**Output (Console):**

```
Calling addDogAndPoodles with List<Animal>:
--- Adding Dogs (Write-Only Access) ---
Successfully added dogs to the list. Current size: 2
First element (read as Object): Dog: Rex
----------------------------------------
Content of List<Animal>: [Dog: Rex, Poodle: Princess]

Calling addDogAndPoodles with List<Object>:
--- Adding Dogs (Write-Only Access) ---
Successfully added dogs to the list. Current size: 2
First element (read as Object): Dog: Rex
----------------------------------------
Content of List<Object>: [Dog: Rex, Poodle: Princess]

Calling addDogAndPoodles with List<Dog>:
--- Adding Dogs (Write-Only Access) ---
Successfully added dogs to the list. Current size: 2
First element (read as Object): Dog: Rex
----------------------------------------
Content of List<Dog>: [Dog: Rex, Poodle: Princess]
```

**Explanation:**
The `addDogAndPoodles` method can accept `List<Dog>`, `List<Animal>`, or `List<Object>` because they are all supertypes of `Dog`. Inside the method, we can safely add `Dog` and `Poodle` objects. If you uncomment the `dogConsumerList.add(new Animal("Lion"))` line, it will cause a compile-time error because `Animal` is not a subtype of `Dog`. When trying to read, we can only retrieve elements as `Object` because the list might be `List<Object>`, and `Object` is the only guaranteed common supertype.

## The PECS Principle: Producer `extends`, Consumer `super`

This mnemonic is key to remembering which wildcard to use:

*   **P**roducer `extends`: If your generic type acts as a **producer** (i.e., you are only *reading* elements from it), use `? extends T`.
    *   Example: `void printAll(List<? extends Number> numbers)` - You read `Number`s out.
*   **C**onsumer `super`: If your generic type acts as a **consumer** (i.e., you are only *writing* elements into it), use `? super T`.
    *   Example: `void addAll(List<? super Integer> integers, List<Integer> source)` - You write `Integer`s into `integers`.

If you need to both read and write specific types to/from the collection, then you cannot use wildcards; you must use the exact generic type, e.g., `List<T>`.

## When to Use Which?

| Scenario                   | `? extends T` (Upper Bounded) | `? super T` (Lower Bounded) | `T` (Exact Type)         |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Reading Elements**       | Yes (as `T`)                  | No (only as `Object`)       | Yes (as `T`)             |
| **Writing (Adding) Elements** | No (only `null`)            | Yes (as `T` or subtype)     | Yes (as `T` or subtype)  |
| **Using as Parameter**     | ✅ (Producer)                 | ✅ (Consumer)               | ✅ (Both read/write)     |
| **Using as Return Type**   | ❌ (Avoid, too restrictive)   | ❌ (Avoid, too restrictive) | ✅ (Clear and specific)  |
| **When to use it**         | When you get (read) items     | When you put (write) items  | When you get AND put items |
| **Flexibility**            | Accepts `T` and its subtypes  | Accepts `T` and its supertypes | Accepts only `T`        |

## Conclusion

Generics wildcards `? extends T` and `? super T` are essential tools for writing robust and flexible Java code. They allow you to define methods and classes that work with a range of generic types, preventing common type errors at compile-time while maintaining the strictness of Java's type system. By applying the PECS principle, you can quickly determine the correct wildcard to use for your generic collection parameters.

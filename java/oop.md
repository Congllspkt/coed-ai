# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Java is a quintessential object-oriented language, and understanding its OOP principles is fundamental to building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

## Core Concepts of OOP

OOP in Java revolves around four main pillars:

1.  **Encapsulation**
2.  **Inheritance**
3.  **Polymorphism**
4.  **Abstraction**

Before diving into these, let's briefly understand **Classes and Objects**, which are the building blocks of OOP.

---

## 1. Classes and Objects

### What are they?

*   **Class:** A blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the common properties (attributes/fields) and behaviors (methods) that all objects of that type will have. Think of it like a cookie cutter.
*   **Object:** An instance of a class. It's a real-world entity that has a state (values of its attributes) and behavior (what it can do). Think of it like a cookie made from the cutter.

### Example: Car Class and Objects

Let's define a `Car` class with some attributes and behaviors.

```java
// Car.java
class Car {
    // Attributes (properties)
    String make;
    String model;
    int year;
    String color;
    double speed;

    // Constructor: A special method used to initialize objects
    public Car(String make, String model, int year, String color) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        this.color = color;
        this.speed = 0.0; // Initial speed is 0
    }

    // Behaviors (methods)
    public void start() {
        System.out.println(make + " " + model + " engine started.");
    }

    public void accelerate(double increment) {
        this.speed += increment;
        System.out.println(make + " " + model + " accelerating. Current speed: " + speed + " mph.");
    }

    public void brake(double decrement) {
        this.speed -= decrement;
        if (this.speed < 0) {
            this.speed = 0;
        }
        System.out.println(make + " " + model + " braking. Current speed: " + speed + " mph.");
    }

    public void stop() {
        this.speed = 0;
        System.out.println(make + " " + model + " stopped.");
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("--- Car Info ---");
        System.out.println("Make: " + make);
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
        System.out.println("Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Current Speed: " + speed + " mph");
        System.out.println("----------------");
    }
}

// Main.java (To demonstrate creating and using Car objects)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects (instances) of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020, "Blue");
        Car anotherCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2023, "Red");

        // Calling methods on the objects
        System.out.println("Operating myCar:");
        myCar.displayInfo();
        myCar.start();
        myCar.accelerate(50);
        myCar.brake(20);
        myCar.stop();
        myCar.displayInfo();

        System.out.println("\nOperating anotherCar:");
        anotherCar.displayInfo();
        anotherCar.start();
        anotherCar.accelerate(70);
        anotherCar.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

#### Input:
(No direct user input for this example, execution demonstrates object interaction)

#### Output:
```
Operating myCar:
--- Car Info ---
Make: Toyota
Model: Camry
Year: 2020
Color: Blue
Current Speed: 0.0 mph
----------------
Toyota Camry engine started.
Toyota Camry accelerating. Current speed: 50.0 mph.
Toyota Camry braking. Current speed: 30.0 mph.
Toyota Camry stopped.
--- Car Info ---
Make: Toyota
Model: Camry
Year: 2020
Color: Blue
Current Speed: 0.0 mph
----------------

Operating anotherCar:
--- Car Info ---
Make: Honda
Model: Civic
Year: 2023
Color: Red
Current Speed: 0.0 mph
----------------
Honda Civic engine started.
Honda Civic accelerating. Current speed: 70.0 mph.
--- Car Info ---
Make: Honda
Model: Civic
Year: 2023
Color: Red
Current Speed: 70.0 mph
----------------
```

## 2. Encapsulation

### What is it?

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (a class). It also refers to the mechanism of restricting direct access to some of an object's components, meaning internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world, and can only be accessed or modified through a set of public methods (getters and setters).

### How in Java?

*   Declare attributes as `private`.
*   Provide `public` "getter" methods to read the attribute values.
*   Provide `public` "setter" methods to modify the attribute values (with potential validation logic).

### Benefits:

*   **Data Hiding:** Prevents direct access to data, protecting its integrity.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows changes to the internal implementation without affecting external code that uses the class.
*   **Control:** Provides control over how data is accessed and modified (e.g., preventing negative speed).

### Example: Encapsulating Car Attributes

Let's modify our `Car` class to encapsulate its attributes.

```java
// EncapsulatedCar.java
class EncapsulatedCar {
    // Attributes (private for encapsulation)
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;
    private double speed; // Made private as well

    // Constructor
    public EncapsulatedCar(String make, String model, int year, String color) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        this.color = color;
        this.speed = 0.0;
    }

    // Public Getter methods
    public String getMake() {
        return make;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public double getSpeed() {
        return speed;
    }

    // Public Setter methods (with validation where applicable)
    public void setColor(String color) {
        // Example: Only allow certain colors (simple validation)
        if (color.equalsIgnoreCase("Red") || color.equalsIgnoreCase("Blue") || color.equalsIgnoreCase("Black")) {
            this.color = color;
            System.out.println("Color updated to: " + color);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid color: " + color + ". Color remains: " + this.color);
        }
    }

    // Methods for behavior (can be public as they interact with private data)
    public void start() {
        System.out.println(make + " " + model + " engine started.");
    }

    public void accelerate(double increment) {
        if (increment > 0) {
            this.speed += increment;
            System.out.println(make + " " + model + " accelerating. Current speed: " + speed + " mph.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Acceleration must be positive.");
        }
    }

    public void brake(double decrement) {
        if (decrement > 0) {
            this.speed -= decrement;
            if (this.speed < 0) {
                this.speed = 0;
            }
            System.out.println(make + " " + model + " braking. Current speed: " + speed + " mph.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Braking decrement must be positive.");
        }
    }

    public void stop() {
        this.speed = 0;
        System.out.println(make + " " + model + " stopped.");
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("\n--- Encapsulated Car Info ---");
        System.out.println("Make: " + getMake()); // Using getter
        System.out.println("Model: " + getModel()); // Using getter
        System.out.println("Year: " + getYear());   // Using getter
        System.out.println("Color: " + getColor()); // Using getter
        System.out.println("Current Speed: " + getSpeed() + " mph"); // Using getter
        System.out.println("--------------------------");
    }
}

// Main.java (To demonstrate Encapsulation)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EncapsulatedCar myEncCar = new EncapsulatedCar("Ford", "Mustang", 2022, "Red");

        myEncCar.displayInfo();

        // Trying to set an invalid color
        myEncCar.setColor("Green");

        // Setting a valid color
        myEncCar.setColor("Black");

        // Trying to directly access a private attribute (will cause compile error)
        // System.out.println(myEncCar.make); // This line would cause a compile-time error

        // Accessing attributes using public getters
        System.out.println("My car's model (using getter): " + myEncCar.getModel());

        // Modifying speed using public methods
        myEncCar.accelerate(60);
        myEncCar.brake(10);
        myEncCar.accelerate(-5); // Invalid acceleration
        myEncCar.brake(-2);      // Invalid braking
        myEncCar.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

#### Input:
(No direct user input)

#### Output:
```
--- Encapsulated Car Info ---
Make: Ford
Model: Mustang
Year: 2022
Color: Red
Current Speed: 0.0 mph
--------------------------
Invalid color: Green. Color remains: Red
Color updated to: Black

## 3. Inheritance

### What is it?

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It represents the "is-a" relationship (e.g., a "Car IS-A Vehicle"). It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

### How in Java?

*   Use the `extends` keyword.
*   The class whose properties are inherited is called the `Parent Class` or `Superclass`.
*   The class that inherits the properties is called the `Child Class` or `Subclass`.
*   A subclass can add new fields and methods, and override methods from the superclass.

### Benefits:

*   **Code Reusability:** Reduces code duplication by allowing common code to be defined once in the superclass.
*   **Maintainability:** Changes in the superclass automatically propagate to subclasses.
*   **Logical Hierarchy:** Organizes classes in a clear, hierarchical structure.

### Example: Vehicle Hierarchy

Let's create a `Vehicle` superclass and then `Car` and `Motorcycle` subclasses.

```java
// Vehicle.java (Superclass)
class Vehicle {
    protected String brand; // protected allows subclasses to access
    protected int speed;

    public Vehicle(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.speed = 0;
    }

    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println(brand + " vehicle engine started.");
    }

    public void stopEngine() {
        System.out.println(brand + " vehicle engine stopped.");
        this.speed = 0;
    }

    public void accelerate(int increment) {
        this.speed += increment;
        System.out.println(brand + " accelerating. Current speed: " + speed + " mph.");
    }

    public void displaySpeed() {
        System.out.println(brand + " current speed: " + speed + " mph.");
    }
}

// Car.java (Subclass of Vehicle)
class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int numberOfDoors;

    public Car(String brand, int numberOfDoors) {
        super(brand); // Call the constructor of the superclass (Vehicle)
        this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println(brand + " car is driving with " + numberOfDoors + " doors.");
    }

    // Method overriding: Providing a specific implementation for startEngine
    @Override // Good practice to use this annotation
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println(brand + " car engine starting with a distinct roar!");
    }
}

// Motorcycle.java (Subclass of Vehicle)
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    private boolean hasSidecar;

    public Motorcycle(String brand, boolean hasSidecar) {
        super(brand);
        this.hasSidecar = hasSidecar;
    }

    public void wheelie() {
        System.out.println(brand + " motorcycle doing a wheelie!");
    }

    // Method overriding
    @Override
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println(brand + " motorcycle engine roaring to life!");
    }
}

// Main.java (To demonstrate Inheritance)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car hondaCivic = new Car("Honda", 4);
        Motorcycle harleyDavidson = new Motorcycle("Harley-Davidson", false);

        System.out.println("--- Honda Civic Actions ---");
        hondaCivic.startEngine(); // Overridden method
        hondaCivic.accelerate(40); // Inherited method
        hondaCivic.drive();        // Car-specific method
        hondaCivic.displaySpeed(); // Inherited method
        hondaCivic.stopEngine();   // Inherited method

        System.out.println("\n--- Harley-Davidson Actions ---");
        harleyDavidson.startEngine(); // Overridden method
        harleyDavidson.accelerate(60); // Inherited method
        harleyDavidson.wheelie();       // Motorcycle-specific method
        harleyDavidson.displaySpeed();  // Inherited method
        harleyDavidson.stopEngine();    // Inherited method
    }
}
```

#### Input:
(No direct user input)

#### Output:
```
--- Honda Civic Actions ---
Honda car engine starting with a distinct roar!
Honda accelerating. Current speed: 40 mph.
Honda car is driving with 4 doors.
Honda current speed: 40 mph.
Honda vehicle engine stopped.

--- Harley-Davidson Actions ---
Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine roaring to life!
Harley-Davidson accelerating. Current speed: 60 mph.
Harley-Davidson motorcycle doing a wheelie!
Harley-Davidson current speed: 60 mph.
Harley-Davidson vehicle engine stopped.
```

## 4. Polymorphism

### What is it?

Polymorphism means "many forms." In Java, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. Specifically, a reference variable of a superclass type can hold a reference to a subclass object. It also applies to methods having the same name but different behaviors based on the object or parameters.

### Types of Polymorphism:

1.  **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):**
    *   Achieved by having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number, type, or order of parameters) within the same class.
    *   The compiler decides which method to call based on the arguments provided.

2.  **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):**
    *   Achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
    *   The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the actual object type, not the reference type.

### Benefits:

*   **Flexibility & Extensibility:** New classes can be added without modifying existing code.
*   **Simplified Code:** Allows writing generic code that works with different object types.

### Example: Polymorphism

#### 4.1. Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)

```java
// Calculator.java
class Calculator {
    // Method 1: Adds two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Adding two integers:");
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method 2: Adds three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        System.out.println("Adding three integers:");
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Method 3: Adds two doubles
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        System.out.println("Adding two doubles:");
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method 4: Adds two strings (concatenation)
    public String add(String s1, String s2) {
        System.out.println("Concatenating two strings:");
        return s1 + s2;
    }
}

// Main.java (To demonstrate Method Overloading)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        System.out.println("Result 1: " + calc.add(5, 10));
        System.out.println("Result 2: " + calc.add(5, 10, 15));
        System.out.println("Result 3: " + calc.add(5.5, 10.2));
        System.out.println("Result 4: " + calc.add("Hello", " World"));
    }
}
```

#### Input:
(No direct user input)

#### Output:
```
Adding two integers:
Result 1: 15
Adding three integers:
Result 2: 30
Adding two doubles:
Result 3: 15.7
Concatenating two strings:
Result 4: Hello World
```

#### 4.2. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)

We've already seen method overriding in the Inheritance example (`startEngine()` in `Car` and `Motorcycle`). Here, let's explicitly demonstrate runtime polymorphism with an array of `Vehicle` references.

```java
// Vehicle.java (Same as before, used as Superclass)
class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;
    protected int speed;

    public Vehicle(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.speed = 0;
    }

    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println(brand + " vehicle engine started.");
    }
    // ... other methods ...
}

// Car.java (Subclass, overriding startEngine())
class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String brand, int numberOfDoors) {
        super(brand);
    }

    @Override
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println(brand + " car engine starting with a distinct roar!");
    }
    // ... other methods ...
}

// Motorcycle.java (Subclass, overriding startEngine())
class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    public Motorcycle(String brand, boolean hasSidecar) {
        super(brand);
    }

    @Override
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println(brand + " motorcycle engine roaring to life!");
    }
    // ... other methods ...
}

// Main.java (To demonstrate Runtime Polymorphism)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects of subclasses
        Vehicle myCar = new Car("Tesla", 4);           // Vehicle reference, Car object
        Vehicle myMotorcycle = new Motorcycle("Ducati", false); // Vehicle reference, Motorcycle object
        Vehicle genericVehicle = new Vehicle("Generic Truck"); // Vehicle reference, Vehicle object

        // Demonstrate runtime polymorphism with individual objects
        System.out.println("--- Individual Objects ---");
        myCar.startEngine();         // Calls Car's startEngine()
        myMotorcycle.startEngine();  // Calls Motorcycle's startEngine()
        genericVehicle.startEngine();// Calls Vehicle's startEngine()

        System.out.println("\n--- Array of Vehicles (Polymorphic Behavior) ---");
        // Create an array of Vehicle references
        Vehicle[] vehicles = new Vehicle[3];
        vehicles[0] = new Car("BMW", 2);
        vehicles[1] = new Motorcycle("Kawasaki", true);
        vehicles[2] = new Vehicle("Boeing"); // A generic vehicle, perhaps a plane engine

        // Loop through the array and call startEngine() on each.
        // The actual method called depends on the *runtime type* of the object.
        for (Vehicle v : vehicles) {
            v.startEngine();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Input:
(No direct user input)

#### Output:
```
--- Individual Objects ---
Tesla car engine starting with a distinct roar!
Ducati motorcycle engine roaring to life!
Generic Truck vehicle engine started.

--- Array of Vehicles (Polymorphic Behavior) ---
BMW car engine starting with a distinct roar!
Kawasaki motorcycle engine roaring to life!
Boeing vehicle engine started.
```

## 5. Abstraction

### What is it?

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It focuses on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it. In Java, abstraction is achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

### How in Java?

1.  **Abstract Classes:**
    *   Declared using the `abstract` keyword.
    *   Cannot be instantiated (you cannot create objects of an abstract class).
    *   Can have both abstract methods (methods without a body, declared `abstract`) and concrete methods (methods with a body).
    *   If a class has at least one abstract method, it must be declared abstract.
    *   Subclasses must implement all abstract methods of their abstract superclass, or they must also be declared abstract.

2.  **Interfaces:**
    *   A blueprint of a class. It can have abstract methods (implicitly `public abstract` before Java 8; after Java 8, can also have `default` and `static` methods with implementations).
    *   All fields are implicitly `public static final`.
    *   A class implements an interface using the `implements` keyword.
    *   A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only extend one class (abstract or concrete).

### Benefits:

*   **Simplification:** Reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details.
*   **Enforced Structure:** Ensures that subclasses or implementing classes provide specific implementations for abstract methods, enforcing a common contract.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows changes to implementation without affecting external interaction.

### Example: Abstraction

#### 5.1. Abstract Class Example: Shape

```java
// Abstract Shape.java
abstract class Shape {
    protected String name;

    public Shape(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Abstract methods: Must be implemented by concrete subclasses
    public abstract double calculateArea();
    public abstract void draw();

    // Concrete method: Can be used by subclasses as is
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a " + name + " shape.");
    }
}

// Circle.java (Concrete subclass of Shape)
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        super("Circle");
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle with radius " + radius);
    }
}

// Rectangle.java (Concrete subclass of Shape)
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        super("Rectangle");
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Rectangle with width " + width + " and height " + height);
    }
}

// Main.java (To demonstrate Abstract Class)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Cannot instantiate an abstract class directly:
        // Shape myShape = new Shape("Generic"); // This would cause a compile-time error

        Shape circle = new Circle(5.0);
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0);

        System.out.println("--- Shape Operations ---");

        circle.displayInfo();
        circle.draw();
        System.out.println("Area of " + circle.name + ": " + circle.calculateArea());

        System.out.println(); // For spacing

#### 5.2. Interface Example: Flyable

```java
// Flyable.java (Interface)
interface Flyable {
    // All methods in an interface are implicitly public abstract (before Java 8)
    // or can be default/static with implementation (Java 8+)
    void fly();
    void land();

    // Default method (Java 8+)
    default void takeOff() {
        System.out.println("Taking off... preparing for flight!");
    }

    // Static method (Java 8+)
    static void describeFlying() {
        System.out.println("This interface defines objects that can fly and land.");
    }
}

// Airplane.java (Class implementing Flyable)
class Airplane implements Flyable {
    private String model;

    public Airplane(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println(model + " is flying high in the sky!");
    }

    @Override
    public void land() {
        System.out.println(model + " is landing safely on the runway.");
    }
}

// Bird.java (Class implementing Flyable)
class Bird implements Flyable {
    private String species;

    public Bird(String species) {
        this.species = species;
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println(species + " is flapping its wings and flying!");
    }

    @Override
    public void land() {
        System.out.println(species + " is landing softly on a branch.");
    }
}

// Main.java (To demonstrate Interface)
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("--- Interface Demonstration ---");
        Flyable.describeFlying(); // Calling static method on interface

        Airplane boeing = new Airplane("Boeing 747");
        Bird eagle = new Bird("Eagle");

        System.out.println("\n--- Airplane Actions ---");
        boeing.takeOff(); // Using default method
        boeing.fly();
        boeing.land();

        System.out.println("\n--- Bird Actions ---");
        eagle.takeOff(); // Using default method
        eagle.fly();
        eagle.land();

        System.out.println("\n--- Polymorphic Interface Array ---");
        Flyable[] flyingObjects = new Flyable[2];
        flyingObjects[0] = new Airplane("Airbus A380");
        flyingObjects[1] = new Bird("Sparrow");

        for (Flyable obj : flyingObjects) {
            obj.takeOff();
            obj.fly();
            obj.land();
            System.out.println("---");
        }
    }
}
```

## Benefits of OOP in Java

1.  **Modularity:** Objects are self-contained units, making it easier to manage and understand the codebase.
2.  **Reusability:** Inheritance and interfaces promote code reuse, reducing development time and effort.
3.  **Maintainability:** Encapsulation helps isolate changes, making it easier to modify or debug parts of the code without affecting others.
4.  **Extensibility:** Polymorphism and abstraction allow for easy addition of new features or types without altering existing code.
5.  **Flexibility:** Allows for multiple implementations of interfaces or abstract classes.
6.  **Reduced Complexity:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable objects makes large systems easier to design and develop.

## Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm that forms the backbone of Java development. By mastering **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**, you can design and build robust, flexible, and maintainable software systems. These principles encourage thinking about software in terms of real-world entities and their interactions, leading to more intuitive and scalable solutions.

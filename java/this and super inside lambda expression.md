When working with `this` and `super` inside lambda expressions in Java, it's crucial to understand a key concept: **lexical scoping**.

Unlike anonymous inner classes (which create a new scope for `this`), lambda expressions do **not** introduce a new scope for `this` or `super`. Instead, they inherit the `this` and `super` references from their **enclosing context** (the class where the lambda is defined).

Let's break it down with details and examples.

# `this` and `super` in Java Lambda Expressions

## 1. `this` in Lambda Expressions

### Explanation

When you use `this` inside a lambda expression, it refers to the instance of the **enclosing class** where the lambda is defined. It does not refer to the lambda expression itself (as lambdas don't have their own instance in the traditional sense, nor do they define a new `this` scope).

This behavior is known as **lexical scoping** â€“ the `this` keyword refers to the same object it would refer to if the code were written directly in the enclosing scope, rather than inside the lambda.

### Example: `this`

Let's see an example where `this` inside a lambda refers to the instance of the `OuterClass`.

```java
// OuterClass.java
public class OuterClass {

    private String outerMessage = "I am the outer instance.";

    public void demonstrateThisInLambda() {
        System.out.println("--- Inside demonstrateThisInLambda() ---");
        System.out.println("this in OuterClass method: " + this.getClass().getName());
        System.out.println("outerMessage via this in method: " + this.outerMessage);

        // Define a Runnable lambda expression
        Runnable lambdaTask = () -> {
            System.out.println("\n--- Inside Lambda Expression ---");
            // 'this' here refers to the OuterClass instance
            System.out.println("this in lambda: " + this.getClass().getName());
            System.out.println("Accessing outerMessage via this in lambda: " + this.outerMessage);
        };

        // Execute the lambda
        lambdaTask.run();

        System.out.println("\n--- Back in demonstrateThisInLambda() ---");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OuterClass outerInstance = new OuterClass();
        outerInstance.demonstrateThisInLambda();
    }
}
```

### Input

To run this example, compile and execute the `OuterClass.java` file:

```bash
javac OuterClass.java
java OuterClass
```

### Output

```
--- Inside demonstrateThisInLambda() ---
this in OuterClass method: OuterClass
outerMessage via this in method: I am the outer instance.

--- Inside Lambda Expression ---
this in lambda: OuterClass
Accessing outerMessage via this in lambda: I am the outer instance.

--- Back in demonstrateThisInLambda() ---
```

**Explanation of Output:**
As you can see, `this.getClass().getName()` prints `OuterClass` both inside the `demonstrateThisInLambda()` method and inside the lambda expression. This confirms that `this` inside the lambda refers to the `OuterClass` instance. Similarly, `this.outerMessage` correctly accesses the `outerMessage` field of the `OuterClass` instance.

## 2. `super` in Lambda Expressions

### Explanation

Just like `this`, the `super` keyword inside a lambda expression also refers to the `super` of the **enclosing class** instance. It allows you to invoke methods or access members of the superclass of the class that contains the lambda.

Again, this is due to **lexical scoping**. The lambda doesn't introduce its own `super` context; it simply uses the `super` reference available in its surrounding code.

### Example: `super`

Let's create a class hierarchy to demonstrate `super` in a lambda.

```java
// BaseClass.java
class BaseClass {
    public void printMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method from BaseClass");
    }

    public String getClassName() {
        return "BaseClass";
    }
}

// DerivedClass.java
public class DerivedClass extends BaseClass {

    @Override
    public void printMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method from DerivedClass");
    }

    public void demonstrateSuperInLambda() {
        System.out.println("--- Inside demonstrateSuperInLambda() (DerivedClass) ---");
        System.out.println("Calling printMethod() from DerivedClass itself:");
        this.printMethod(); // Calls DerivedClass's printMethod()
        
        System.out.println("\nCalling super.printMethod() directly:");
        super.printMethod(); // Calls BaseClass's printMethod()

        // Define a Runnable lambda expression
        Runnable lambdaTask = () -> {
            System.out.println("\n--- Inside Lambda Expression ---");
            // 'super' here refers to the superclass of DerivedClass (i.e., BaseClass)
            System.out.println("Calling super.printMethod() from lambda:");
            super.printMethod(); // Calls BaseClass's printMethod()

            System.out.println("Accessing super.getClassName() from lambda: " + super.getClassName());
        };

        // Execute the lambda
        lambdaTask.run();

        System.out.println("\n--- Back in demonstrateSuperInLambda() ---");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DerivedClass derivedInstance = new DerivedClass();
        derivedInstance.demonstrateSuperInLambda();
    }
}
```

### Input

To run this example, compile and execute the `DerivedClass.java` file (it will automatically compile `BaseClass.java` if not already compiled):

```bash
javac DerivedClass.java
java DerivedClass
```

### Output

```
--- Inside demonstrateSuperInLambda() (DerivedClass) ---
Calling printMethod() from DerivedClass itself:
Method from DerivedClass

Calling super.printMethod() directly:
Method from BaseClass

--- Inside Lambda Expression ---
Calling super.printMethod() from lambda:
Method from BaseClass
Accessing super.getClassName() from lambda: BaseClass

--- Back in demonstrateSuperInLambda() ---
```

**Explanation of Output:**
The output clearly shows that `super.printMethod()` and `super.getClassName()` inside the lambda expression successfully invoke the methods of the `BaseClass`. This demonstrates that `super` within a lambda refers to the superclass of the `DerivedClass` instance, just as it would outside the lambda in the `demonstrateSuperInLambda()` method itself.

## Key Takeaway

The fundamental rule to remember for `this` and `super` in lambda expressions is **lexical scoping**:

*   **`this`** refers to the instance of the **enclosing class** where the lambda is defined.
*   **`super`** refers to the superclass of the **enclosing class** where the lambda is defined.

Lambdas do not create a new `this` or `super` context; they simply use the context in which they are declared. This makes them behave more like blocks of code embedded directly into the enclosing method, rather than entirely separate entities like anonymous inner classes.

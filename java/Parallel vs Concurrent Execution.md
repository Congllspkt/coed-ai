## 1. Introduction

*   **Concurrency** is about *dealing with many things at once*. It's a way to structure your program so that multiple tasks can be in progress over the same period, even if only one task is truly executing at any given instant.
*   **Parallelism** is about *doing many things at once*. It means that multiple tasks are genuinely executing simultaneously at the same physical time, requiring multiple processing units (cores, CPUs).

In Java, you write concurrent code, and the underlying system (JVM, Operating System scheduler, and hardware) determines if and how that code is executed in parallel.

---

## 2. Concurrency in Java

### Definition
**Concurrency** refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time, giving the *illusion* that tasks are running simultaneously, even if they are actually being interleaved on a single processing unit. The focus is on managing tasks to make progress on multiple fronts.

### Analogy
Imagine a **single chef** in a kitchen who takes multiple orders. The chef might start preparing dish A, then switch to chopping vegetables for dish B, then quickly stir sauce for dish C, before returning to finish dish A. All dishes are "in progress," but the chef is only actively working on one at any given moment.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Single Core or Multi-Core:** Can be achieved on a single-core processor (via time-slicing and context switching) or multiple cores.
*   **Task Management:** Focuses on managing the execution flow of multiple tasks to ensure progress and responsiveness.
*   **Illusion of Parallelism:** Creates the perception that multiple tasks are running at the same time, even if they are just rapidly switching.

### Java Mechanisms for Concurrency
Java provides rich features for writing concurrent applications:
*   **`Thread` class and `Runnable` interface:** The basic building blocks for creating independent units of execution.
*   **`ExecutorService` and `Executors` utility class:** Higher-level APIs for managing thread pools, abstracting away direct thread management. This is generally preferred over direct `Thread` creation.
*   **`Callable` and `Future`:** For tasks that return a result or throw an exception.
*   **`synchronized` keyword, `Lock` interface (e.g., `ReentrantLock`):** Mechanisms for ensuring thread safety when multiple threads access shared resources.
*   **`java.util.concurrent` package:** Provides many concurrent data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `BlockingQueue`), atomic variables (`AtomicInteger`), and synchronization tools.

### Concurrency Example (Interleaving)

This example demonstrates concurrency using an `ExecutorService`. Even on a multi-core machine, if the tasks are short and the thread pool size is small, you might observe interleaving of output as the scheduler switches between threads.

```java
// File: ConcurrentExecutionExample.java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private String name;

    public Task(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + name + ": Starting...");
        try {
            // Simulate some work
            Thread.sleep((long) (Math.random() * 500)); 
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + name + ": Interrupted!");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + name + ": Finished.");
    }
}

public class ConcurrentExecutionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("--- Concurrency Example ---");
        System.out.println("Main thread: Starting tasks...");

        // Create an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool size (e.g., 2 threads)
        // This pool will manage a limited number of threads to execute tasks.
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); 

        // Submit multiple tasks to the executor
        executor.submit(new Task("Task 1"));
        executor.submit(new Task("Task 2"));
        executor.submit(new Task("Task 3"));
        executor.submit(new Task("Task 4"));
        executor.submit(new Task("Task 5"));

        // Shut down the executor. It will stop accepting new tasks 
        // and finish all submitted tasks.
        executor.shutdown();

        try {
            // Wait for all tasks to complete, or timeout after 1 minute
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES)) {
                System.out.println("Tasks did not complete in time!");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.err.println("Main thread interrupted while waiting for tasks.");
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread: All tasks submitted and executor shut down.");
    }
}
```

#### Input
No specific input is required; the program is self-contained.

#### Compile and Run
```bash
javac ConcurrentExecutionExample.java
java ConcurrentExecutionExample
```

#### Possible Output (Illustrates Interleaving)
The exact order can vary with each run, but you'll notice how tasks are executed by the `pool-x-thread-y` threads in an interleaved fashion, demonstrating concurrency.

```
--- Concurrency Example ---
Main thread: Starting tasks...
pool-1-thread-1 - Task 1: Starting...
pool-1-thread-2 - Task 2: Starting...
pool-1-thread-1 - Task 1: Finished.
pool-1-thread-1 - Task 3: Starting...
pool-1-thread-2 - Task 2: Finished.
pool-1-thread-2 - Task 4: Starting...
pool-1-thread-1 - Task 3: Finished.
pool-1-thread-1 - Task 5: Starting...
pool-1-thread-2 - Task 4: Finished.
pool-1-thread-1 - Task 5: Finished.
Main thread: All tasks submitted and executor shut down.
```
**Explanation of Output:**
*   You can see `Task 1` and `Task 2` start almost simultaneously (or very close).
*   `pool-1-thread-1` finishes `Task 1` and then immediately picks up `Task 3`.
*   `pool-1-thread-2` finishes `Task 2` and then picks up `Task 4`.
*   This pattern of threads picking up new tasks after finishing old ones, and tasks executing concurrently (even if not strictly in parallel on the same nanosecond), is the essence of concurrency.

## 3. Parallelism in Java

### Definition
**Parallelism** refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or parts of a single task on multiple processing units (cores, CPUs). The goal is to achieve actual speedup by literally doing more than one thing at the exact same time.

### Analogy
Now imagine a **team of chefs** (each a dedicated processing unit) in a kitchen. If three orders come in, three chefs can simultaneously work on each order, speeding up the overall process significantly.

### Key Characteristics
*   **Multiple Cores Required:** Cannot be achieved on a single-core processor. Requires hardware that can execute multiple instructions streams concurrently.
*   **True Simultaneous Execution:** Tasks or sub-tasks genuinely run at the same physical instant.
*   **Speedup:** The primary goal is to reduce the total execution time for computationally intensive tasks.

### Java Mechanisms for Parallelism
While concurrency mechanisms often enable parallelism, here are ways Java explicitly supports or leverages parallelism:
*   **`ExecutorService` with more threads than logical cores:** If your thread pool size (`newFixedThreadPool(N)`) is greater than 1 and you have `N` or more available CPU cores, the OS scheduler will distribute these threads across cores, leading to parallel execution.
*   **Java 8 Streams API `parallelStream()`:** This is a very common and explicit way to leverage parallelism for data processing. When you call `.parallelStream()` on a collection, the stream operations (like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) can be performed in parallel across multiple threads (typically using the common `ForkJoinPool`).
*   **`ForkJoinPool`:** A specialized `ExecutorService` designed for work-stealing algorithms, which is excellent for divide-and-conquer problems, and is used internally by parallel streams.

### Parallelism Example (Speedup)

This example uses Java 8 `parallelStream()` to demonstrate parallelism by calculating the sum of squares of a large list of numbers. We'll compare the execution time of a sequential stream versus a parallel stream.

```java
// File: ParallelExecutionExample.java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.LongStream;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class ParallelExecutionExample {

    // A simple method to simulate a CPU-bound task for each number
    private static long calculateSquare(long number) {
        // In a real scenario, this would be a more complex calculation
        // or a task that requires significant CPU time.
        // For demonstration, we simply square it.
        return number * number;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("--- Parallelism Example ---");

        int numElements = 20_000_000; // A large number to make the difference noticeable
        List<Long> numbers = LongStream.range(0, numElements)
                                     .boxed()
                                     .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println("Calculating sum of squares for " + numElements + " numbers.");

        // --- Sequential Stream ---
        long startTimeSequential = System.nanoTime();
        long sumSequential = numbers.stream()
                                    .mapToLong(ParallelExecutionExample::calculateSquare)
                                    .sum();
        long endTimeSequential = System.nanoTime();
        long durationSequential = (endTimeSequential - startTimeSequential) / 1_000_000; // milliseconds

        System.out.println("Sequential Stream Result: " + sumSequential);
        System.out.println("Sequential Stream Time: " + durationSequential + " ms");

        System.out.println("\n--- Starting Parallel Stream ---");
        // --- Parallel Stream ---
        long startTimeParallel = System.nanoTime();
        long sumParallel = numbers.parallelStream() // KEY: Using parallelStream()
                                  .mapToLong(ParallelExecutionExample::calculateSquare)
                                  .sum();
        long endTimeParallel = System.nanoTime();
        long durationParallel = (endTimeParallel - startTimeParallel) / 1_000_000; // milliseconds

        System.out.println("Parallel Stream Result: " + sumParallel);
        System.out.println("Parallel Stream Time: " + durationParallel + " ms");

        System.out.println("\nComparison:");
        System.out.println("Parallel Stream was " + 
                           String.format("%.2f", (double)durationSequential / durationParallel) + 
                           "x faster than Sequential Stream.");
        
        // Verify results are identical
        if (sumSequential == sumParallel) {
            System.out.println("Results are identical (correctness check passed).");
        } else {
            System.err.println("ERROR: Results are NOT identical!");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Input
No specific input is required; the program is self-contained.

#### Compile and Run
```bash
javac ParallelExecutionExample.java
java ParallelExecutionExample
```

#### Possible Output (Illustrates Speedup)
The exact times will vary significantly based on your CPU, its core count, and current load. However, you should consistently observe that the `Parallel Stream Time` is significantly less than the `Sequential Stream Time` on a multi-core machine.

```
--- Parallelism Example ---
Calculating sum of squares for 20000000 numbers.
Sequential Stream Result: 2666666533333350000
Sequential Stream Time: 345 ms

--- Starting Parallel Stream ---
Parallel Stream Result: 2666666533333350000
Parallel Stream Time: 105 ms

Comparison:
Parallel Stream was 3.29x faster than Sequential Stream.
Results are identical (correctness check passed).
```
**Explanation of Output:**
*   The `Sequential Stream` processes all 20 million numbers on a single thread.
*   The `Parallel Stream` divides the work among multiple threads (typically using the `ForkJoinPool`, which utilizes all available CPU cores by default) and performs the `mapToLong` and `sum` operations concurrently.
*   The significant reduction in `Parallel Stream Time` demonstrates the benefits of parallelism for CPU-bound tasks on multi-core hardware. The speedup factor (e.g., 3.29x in the example) will depend on the number of logical cores your CPU has and other system factors.

## 4. Key Differences: Concurrency vs. Parallelism

| Feature             | Concurrency                                     | Parallelism                                    |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept**         | Dealing with many things at once (management)   | Doing many things at once (execution)          |
| **Execution Model** | Interleaved execution (task switching)          | Simultaneous execution (truly at the same time) |
| **Hardware Req.**   | Can be achieved on a single CPU core            | Requires multiple CPU cores or processors      |
| **Goal**            | Responsiveness, better resource utilization, managing independent tasks | Speedup, throughput increase for CPU-bound tasks |
| **Visibility**      | Illusion of simultaneous progress               | Actual simultaneous progress                   |
| **Java Impl.**      | `Thread`, `Runnable`, `ExecutorService`, `synchronized`, `Lock`, `java.util.concurrent` package | `ExecutorService` (with sufficient threads/cores), `parallelStream()`, `ForkJoinPool` |
| **Primary Benefit** | Keeps the system responsive during long operations | Reduces the total time taken for a computation |

## 5. When to Use Which?

**Use Concurrency when:**
*   You have **I/O-bound tasks** (e.g., reading from disk, network requests, database queries). While one task waits for I/O, another can run, improving overall throughput.
*   You want your application to remain **responsive** (e.g., a GUI application shouldn't freeze while performing a long calculation).
*   You need to **manage multiple independent tasks** that don't necessarily need to complete faster individually, but need to be handled simultaneously.
*   You are working on a **single-core processor** and still need to handle multiple tasks "at once."

**Use Parallelism when:**
*   You have **CPU-bound tasks** (e.g., heavy mathematical computations, image processing, large data analysis).
*   You want to **speed up** the execution of a single large task by breaking it into smaller sub-tasks and processing them simultaneously.
*   You are working on a **multi-core processor** and want to fully utilize its capabilities.
*   The **order of execution** of sub-tasks doesn't matter, or the result can be combined deterministically.

---

## 6. Important Considerations for Both

When implementing concurrent or parallel solutions in Java, you must be aware of potential challenges:

*   **Thread Safety:** When multiple threads access shared mutable data, you need synchronization mechanisms (`synchronized`, `Lock`s, `Atomic` classes) to prevent data corruption (race conditions).
*   **Deadlock:** Two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release a resource.
*   **Livelock:** Threads are not blocked but are continuously changing their state in response to other threads, preventing any actual work from being done.
*   **Starvation:** A thread is perpetually denied access to a shared resource or CPU time.
*   **Performance Overhead:** Creating and managing threads, context switching, and synchronization all introduce overhead. Sometimes, a sequential solution can be faster for small tasks or data sets due to this overhead.
*   **Debugging Complexity:** Debugging multithreaded applications is notoriously difficult due to non-deterministic execution paths and subtle timing issues.
*   **Resource Management:** Proper shutdown of `ExecutorService` instances, closing resources, and handling exceptions across threads are crucial.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Concurrency is a broader concept that deals with structuring a program to handle multiple tasks by overlapping their execution, which can be achieved even on a single processor. Parallelism is a specific form of concurrency that involves true simultaneous execution of tasks on multiple processing units to achieve speedup.

In Java, you primarily write *concurrent* code using constructs like `Threads`, `Runnables`, and `ExecutorServices`. Whether this code executes *in parallel* depends on the underlying hardware (multi-core CPU) and the OS/JVM scheduler's ability to distribute threads across those cores. Tools like `parallelStream()` explicitly tell the JVM to attempt parallel execution for stream operations, leveraging the available cores for faster processing of CPU-bound tasks. Mastering both concepts is key to building efficient and scalable Java applications.

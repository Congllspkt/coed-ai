# AWS CloudFormation: Infrastructure as Code

## Introduction to CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time on individual resource configuration and more time on your applications running in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon DynamoDB tables, etc.), and CloudFormation handles the provisioning and configuration of those resources for you.

Think of CloudFormation as a blueprint for your entire AWS infrastructure. Instead of manually clicking through the AWS Management Console to create resources one by one, you write a descriptive text file (in YAML or JSON format) that CloudFormation uses to build everything for you in an automated, repeatable, and consistent manner. This is often referred to as **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Template:**
    *   A text file (YAML or JSON) that defines the AWS resources you want to create.
    *   It specifies the resource types, properties, and dependencies between them.
    *   It can include parameters for customization, mappings for conditional values, conditions for conditional resource creation, and outputs to export information.

2.  **Stack:**
    *   A collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit.
    *   When you create a CloudFormation stack, CloudFormation provisions the resources defined in your template.
    *   All the resources in a stack are created, updated, or deleted together.

3.  **Change Set:**
    *   Allows you to preview how proposed changes to your stack will impact your running resources before you implement them.
    *   It shows which resources will be created, modified, or deleted. This is crucial for avoiding unintended changes.

4.  **StackSet (Advanced Concept):**
    *   Extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to provision common AWS resources across multiple AWS accounts and Regions with a single CloudFormation template.

## How CloudFormation Works

1.  **Author a Template:** You write a CloudFormation template in YAML or JSON, defining your desired AWS resources and their configurations.
2.  **Upload Template:** You upload your template to an S3 bucket or directly provide it during stack creation.
3.  **Create a Stack:** You use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to create a new CloudFormation stack, pointing to your template.
4.  **Provision Resources:** CloudFormation reads your template, makes calls to the AWS APIs on your behalf, and provisions the specified resources in the correct order, handling dependencies.
5.  **Monitor:** You can monitor the progress of your stack creation, update, or deletion through the CloudFormation console or CLI.
6.  **Manage:** You can update the stack by providing a modified template, create change sets to preview changes, or delete the stack to tear down all its resources.

## Benefits of CloudFormation

*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Manage your infrastructure like application code (version control, code reviews, automation).
*   **Automation:** Automate the provisioning and updating of your AWS resources, reducing manual effort and errors.
*   **Repeatability & Consistency:** Easily replicate your infrastructure across different environments (dev, test, prod) or regions with identical configurations.
*   **Dependency Management:** CloudFormation automatically manages the dependencies between resources.
*   **Rollback Capability:** If stack creation or update fails, CloudFormation can automatically roll back changes to a known good state.
*   **Cost Control:** Easily delete entire stacks (and all their associated resources) when no longer needed, helping to manage costs.
*   **Change Management:** Change sets provide a clear preview of changes before they are applied.

## CloudFormation Template Structure

A CloudFormation template consists of several top-level sections, though not all are required for every template:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09" # Required, specifies the template capabilities
Description: "A human-readable description of the template" # Optional
Metadata: # Optional, arbitrary key-value pairs
  ManagedBy: "CloudFormation"

Parameters: # Optional, input values that you can pass to your template
  # ...

Mappings: # Optional, a map of keys and associated values
  # ...

Conditions: # Optional, statements that control whether resources are created or properties are applied
  # ...

Resources: # Required, declares the AWS resources that you want to include in the stack
  # ...

Outputs: # Optional, values that you can use to view stack properties or export to other stacks
  # ...
```

---

## Examples

Let's walk through examples, from basic to more advanced concepts.

### Example 1: Basic S3 Bucket

This example creates a simple S3 bucket with a unique name.

**Goal:** Create a private S3 bucket.

#### Input: `s3-bucket-template.yaml`

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "CloudFormation template to create a simple S3 bucket."

Resources:
  MySimpleS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub "my-unique-cf-bucket-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}" # Using Fn::Sub to ensure uniqueness
      Tags:
        - Key: Environment
          Value: Dev
        - Key: ManagedBy
          Value: CloudFormation
```

**Explanation:**
*   `AWSTemplateFormatVersion`: Standard version.
*   `Description`: Provides context.
*   `Resources`: This is where you define your AWS resources.
    *   `MySimpleS3Bucket`: This is a **Logical ID** you define. It must be unique within your template. CloudFormation uses this to refer to the resource internally.
    *   `Type: AWS::S3::Bucket`: This specifies the AWS resource type. AWS uses a standard naming convention `AWS::Service::Resource`.
    *   `Properties`: These are the configuration settings for the S3 bucket.
        *   `BucketName`: We use `!Sub` (shorthand for `Fn::Sub`) to create a unique bucket name by embedding the AWS account ID and region. S3 bucket names must be globally unique.
        *   `Tags`: Key-value pairs for organizational purposes.

#### Deploying the Stack (Using AWS CLI)

1.  **Save the template:** Save the above content as `s3-bucket-template.yaml`.
2.  **Create the stack:**

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
      --stack-name MySimpleS3BucketStack \
      --template-body file://s3-bucket-template.yaml \
      --region us-east-1
    ```

#### Output (Conceptual)

Upon successful creation, CloudFormation will:
*   Display a `StackId` (e.g., `arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/MySimpleS3BucketStack/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`).
*   In the AWS CloudFormation console (under `us-east-1` in this example), you would see:
    *   A new stack named `MySimpleS3BucketStack` with status `CREATE_COMPLETE`.
    *   Under the "Resources" tab of the stack, you would see `MySimpleS3Bucket` (the Logical ID) and its corresponding `Physical ID` (e.g., `my-unique-cf-bucket-123456789012-us-east-1`), which is the actual S3 bucket name.
    *   Under the "Events" tab, you'd see a sequence of events showing the creation progress for the stack and the S3 bucket.
*   You could then navigate to the S3 console and find your newly created bucket.

### Example 2: EC2 Instance with Parameters and Outputs

This example demonstrates how to use `Parameters` to make your template reusable and `Outputs` to retrieve information from your stack.

**Goal:** Create an EC2 instance, allowing the user to specify the instance type and key pair. Then, output the EC2 instance ID and public IP address.

#### Input: `ec2-instance-template.yaml`

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "CloudFormation template to create a basic EC2 instance with custom parameters and outputs."

Parameters:
  InstanceType:
    Description: "Choose an EC2 instance type."
    Type: String
    Default: t2.micro
    AllowedValues:
      - t2.micro
      - t2.small
      - t3.micro
      - t3.small
    ConstraintDescription: "Must be a valid EC2 instance type."

  KeyName:
    Description: "Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance."
    Type: AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName
    ConstraintDescription: "Must be the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair."

Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-053b0d53c279acc90 # Example Amazon Linux 2 AMI for us-east-1 (check latest for your region)
      InstanceType: !Ref InstanceType # Uses the value from the InstanceType parameter
      KeyName: !Ref KeyName # Uses the value from the KeyName parameter
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}-Instance"
        - Key: Environment
          Value: Dev
      UserData: # Simple script to install nginx
        Fn::Base64: |
          #!/bin/bash
          sudo yum update -y
          sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
          sudo systemctl start nginx
          sudo systemctl enable nginx
  
  MySecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupName: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}-SG"
      GroupDescription: "Allow HTTP and SSH access"
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 80
          ToPort: 80
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}-SG"

Outputs:
  InstanceId:
    Description: "The ID of the EC2 instance."
    Value: !Ref MyEC2Instance # References the Logical ID of the EC2 instance
  PublicIp:
    Description: "The Public IP address of the EC2 instance."
    Value: !GetAtt MyEC2Instance.PublicIp # Gets a specific attribute of the EC2 instance
  WebsiteURL:
    Description: "The URL of the Nginx website."
    Value: !Sub "http://${MyEC2Instance.PublicIp}"
    Export:
      Name: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}-WebsiteURL" # Exports the output for use by other stacks
```

**Explanation of New Concepts:**

*   **`Parameters` Section:**
    *   `InstanceType` and `KeyName`: These define input variables that a user must provide (or accept the default) when creating the stack.
    *   `Type`: Specifies the data type (e.g., `String`, `Number`, `AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName`). `AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName` is a special type that validates against existing key pairs in your account.
    *   `Default`: A pre-selected value if the user doesn't provide one.
    *   `AllowedValues`: A list of acceptable values for the parameter.
    *   `ConstraintDescription`: A message displayed if the constraint is violated.
*   **`Resources` Section (`MyEC2Instance`):**
    *   `ImageId`: The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use. **Crucially, AMIs are region-specific.** You'll need to find a valid AMI for your chosen region (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 AMI).
    *   `InstanceType: !Ref InstanceType`: `!Ref` (shorthand for `Fn::Ref`) is an **Intrinsic Function** used to get the value of a parameter or the physical ID of a resource. Here, it gets the value passed to the `InstanceType` parameter.
    *   `KeyName: !Ref KeyName`: Gets the value passed to the `KeyName` parameter.
    *   `UserData`: A script that runs when the instance first launches. Here, it installs Nginx. `Fn::Base64` is used to encode the script.
*   **`Outputs` Section:**
    *   `InstanceId`: Exports the physical ID of the `MyEC2Instance` resource using `!Ref`.
    *   `PublicIp`: Exports a specific attribute of the `MyEC2Instance` resource using `!GetAtt` (shorthand for `Fn::GetAtt`). `!GetAtt MyEC2Instance.PublicIp` retrieves the `PublicIp` attribute of the resource with Logical ID `MyEC2Instance`.
    *   `WebsiteURL`: Creates a dynamic URL using `!Sub` and combining the string with the instance's public IP.
    *   `Export: Name`: Makes the output value available for other CloudFormation stacks in the same AWS account and region to reference. The name `!Sub "${AWS::StackName}-WebsiteURL"` ensures the export name is unique.

#### Deploying the Stack (Using AWS CLI)

1.  **Save the template:** Save the above content as `ec2-instance-template.yaml`.
2.  **Ensure you have an EC2 Key Pair** in your `us-east-1` region. If not, create one via the EC2 console or CLI. Let's assume it's named `my-ssh-key`.
3.  **Create the stack:**

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
      --stack-name MyEC2Stack \
      --template-body file://ec2-instance-template.yaml \
      --parameters ParameterKey=InstanceType,ParameterValue=t2.micro ParameterKey=KeyName,ParameterValue=my-ssh-key \
      --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
      --region us-east-1
    ```

    *   `--parameters`: Used to pass values for the `Parameters` defined in the template.
    *   `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM`: Required if your template creates or modifies IAM resources (like IAM roles or profiles implicitly created for EC2 instances) or has explicit IAM resource definitions. While this specific template *doesn't* explicitly create IAM roles, it's good practice to include it when dealing with compute resources, as they often interact with IAM.

#### Output (Conceptual)

Upon successful creation, CloudFormation will:
*   Display a `StackId`.
*   In the AWS CloudFormation console:
    *   A new stack named `MyEC2Stack` with status `CREATE_COMPLETE`.
    *   Under the "Resources" tab: You'd see `MyEC2Instance` and its `Physical ID` (e.g., `i-0abcdef1234567890`), and `MySecurityGroup` and its `Physical ID` (e.g., `sg-0abcdef1234567890`).
    *   Under the "Outputs" tab:
        *   `InstanceId`: `i-0abcdef1234567890`
        *   `PublicIp`: `3.89.123.45` (a dynamic public IP)
        *   `WebsiteURL`: `http://3.89.123.45`
*   You could then navigate to the EC2 console and find your running instance, verify its instance type, key pair, and public IP.
*   You could also attempt to access the `WebsiteURL` in your browser after the instance has fully started and the Nginx service is running.

### Example 3: Cross-Stack Reference (Using Exports)

This example shows how to reference an output from another stack that was exported.

**Goal:** Create a new resource that needs the S3 bucket name from `MySimpleS3BucketStack` (from Example 1).

#### Input: `cross-stack-reference-template.yaml`

Assume `MySimpleS3BucketStack` from Example 1 has been modified to export its bucket name:

**Updated `s3-bucket-template.yaml` (re-deploy this first):**
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "CloudFormation template to create a simple S3 bucket and export its name."

Resources:
  MySimpleS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub "my-unique-cf-bucket-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}"
      Tags:
        - Key: Environment
          Value: Dev
        - Key: ManagedBy
          Value: CloudFormation

Outputs:
  BucketName:
    Description: "Name of the S3 bucket created."
    Value: !Ref MySimpleS3Bucket
    Export:
      Name: MyExportedS3BucketName # The name other stacks will use to reference this output
```

**New Template for Cross-Stack Reference:** `another-resource-template.yaml`
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "Creates a resource that references an exported S3 bucket name."

Resources:
  MyDummyResource:
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic # Using an SNS topic as an example resource
    Properties:
      DisplayName: "Notification Topic for S3 Bucket"
      TopicName: !Sub "notifications-for-${AWS::StackName}"
      # Example of using an exported value in a property
      # Note: This is a placeholder. Real-world scenarios might involve
      # giving an EC2 instance permissions to access that bucket,
      # or configuring a Lambda function.
      Tags:
        - Key: SourceBucket
          Value: !ImportValue MyExportedS3BucketName # Imports the value exported from the S3 stack
        - Key: ManagedBy
          Value: CloudFormation
```

**Explanation:**
*   **`Outputs` with `Export`:** In the updated S3 template, `Export: Name: MyExportedS3BucketName` makes the bucket's name available to other stacks under the identifier `MyExportedS3BucketName`.
*   **`!ImportValue`:** In `another-resource-template.yaml`, `!ImportValue MyExportedS3BucketName` is used to fetch the value that was exported by the `MySimpleS3BucketStack`. This allows different CloudFormation stacks to share information.

#### Deploying the Stack (Using AWS CLI)

1.  **Update the first stack (if you've already created it, otherwise just create it):**

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation update-stack \
      --stack-name MySimpleS3BucketStack \
      --template-body file://s3-bucket-template.yaml \
      --region us-east-1
    ```
    Wait for `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.

2.  **Create the second stack:**

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
      --stack-name AnotherResourceStack \
      --template-body file://another-resource-template.yaml \
      --region us-east-1
    ```

#### Output (Conceptual)

*   `AnotherResourceStack` will be created successfully.
*   The `MyDummyResource` (SNS Topic) will have a tag named `SourceBucket` with the value of your S3 bucket name (e.g., `my-unique-cf-bucket-123456789012-us-east-1`), demonstrating that the cross-stack reference worked.

## Working with CloudFormation

### AWS Management Console

1.  **Navigate to CloudFormation:** Open the AWS Management Console, search for "CloudFormation."
2.  **Create Stack:** Click "Create stack."
3.  **Specify template:**
    *   "Template is ready"
    *   "Upload a template file" (browse for your `.yaml` or `.json` file) or "Amazon S3 URL" (if uploaded to S3).
4.  **Specify stack details:**
    *   **Stack name:** A unique name for your stack (e.g., `MyEC2Stack`).
    *   **Parameters:** If your template has parameters, you'll see input fields to provide values for them.
5.  **Configure stack options (optional):** Tags, IAM role (for CloudFormation to assume), rollback configuration, notification options.
6.  **Review:** Review all the settings.
7.  **Capabilities:** Acknowledge if your template creates IAM resources or uses nested stacks.
8.  **Create stack:** Click "Create stack."
9.  **Monitor:** Go to the "Events" tab to watch the creation progress. "Resources" tab shows the physical IDs. "Outputs" tab shows the exported values.

### AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provides powerful ways to manage CloudFormation stacks.

*   **`create-stack`:** Creates a new stack.

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
      --stack-name MyNewStack \
      --template-body file://path/to/your/template.yaml \
      --parameters ParameterKey=MyParam,ParameterValue=MyValue \
      --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM # If your template creates IAM resources
    ```

*   **`update-stack`:** Updates an existing stack. CloudFormation automatically determines the minimal changes needed.

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation update-stack \
      --stack-name MyNewStack \
      --template-body file://path/to/your/updated-template.yaml \
      --parameters ParameterKey=MyParam,ParameterValue=NewValue \
      --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
    ```

*   **`delete-stack`:** Deletes a stack and all its associated resources. **Use with caution!**

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack \
      --stack-name MyNewStack
    ```

*   **`describe-stacks`:** Get information about stacks.

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name MyNewStack
    ```

*   **`describe-stack-events`:** View events for a stack.

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name MyNewStack
    ```

*   **`create-change-set` and `execute-change-set`:** For previewing and then applying changes.

    ```bash
    # Create a change set to preview changes
    aws cloudformation create-change-set \
      --stack-name MyNewStack \
      --template-body file://path/to/your/updated-template.yaml \
      --change-set-name MyChangeSet \
      --change-set-type UPDATE \
      --parameters ParameterKey=MyParam,ParameterValue=NewValue

    # Describe the change set to see what will change
    aws cloudformation describe-change-set --stack-name MyNewStack --change-set-name MyChangeSet

    # Execute the change set if you're happy with the preview
    aws cloudformation execute-change-set --stack-name MyNewStack --change-set-name MyChangeSet
    ```

## Best Practices

*   **Version Control:** Store your CloudFormation templates in a version control system (e.g., Git) like any other code.
*   **Modularize with Nested Stacks:** For complex infrastructures, break down your template into smaller, reusable components (e.g., a network stack, a database stack, an application stack). Use `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` to create nested stacks.
*   **Parameterize for Flexibility:** Use parameters extensively to make your templates reusable across different environments or configurations.
*   **Use Outputs for Cross-Stack References:** Export values from one stack using `Outputs` with the `Export` property, and import them into other stacks using `!ImportValue`.
*   **Validate Templates:** Use the `aws cloudformation validate-template` CLI command or a linter (like `cfn-lint`) to catch syntax errors before deployment.
*   **Use Change Sets:** Always use change sets before updating a production stack to understand the impact of your changes.
*   **Grant Least Privilege:** Ensure the IAM role that CloudFormation assumes has only the necessary permissions to create, update, and delete the resources defined in your template.
*   **Add Descriptions and Comments:** Clearly describe your templates, parameters, resources, and outputs for better maintainability.
*   **Error Handling and Rollbacks:** Understand how CloudFormation handles failures and leverage its automatic rollback capabilities.
*   **Drift Detection:** Regularly use CloudFormation's drift detection feature to identify resources that have been manually changed outside of CloudFormation.
